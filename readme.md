# STR Reward Zone

## What does it offer?

* Allows admins to create **Reward Zones** and configure their behavior and rewards
* A player receives a reward once they reach the **Reward Zone**

## How does it work?

#### Admin

1. Selects a region that will become the **Reward Zone**
2. Creates the **Reward Zone**
3. Configures the zone’s mode and cooldown (global cooldown / per-player cooldown / no cooldown at all)
4. Sets up the reward pool (e.g., adds UberSword, SuperPickaxe, MegaShovel, etc.)
5. Chooses a reward distribution mode (entire pool / one random item from the pool / several items from the pool)
6. Configures pool depletion (if someone takes the UberSword – no one else can get it)

#### Player

1. Reaches the **Reward Zone**
2. Receives the reward (according to the settings)
3. The zone goes on cooldown / or the player can no longer receive rewards in this zone (depending on the settings)

## How can this be used?

* Rewards for completing parkour
* Hidden treasures (that cheaters cannot spot with X-Ray)
* Spawn points for medkits/weapons on PvP arenas
* Solving the elytra problem on the server
* Creating kits for players
* Anything else you can imagine (depends on your creativity)
